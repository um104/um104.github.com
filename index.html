<h1>My GitHub Page</h1>
<p>I have no idea what I'm doing. I probably won't be writing my own HTML for long, and instead I'll head over to something like Jekyll or Octopress. Write all my stuff in Markdown.</p>
<p>Or I'll use Twitter Bootstrap or HTML5 Boilerplate, or Skeleton or 960px or jQuery or Angular.js or impress.js or jmpress.js or any number of things. Who knows? The possibilities are seemingly endless, and rather than make the web more inviting, it's making it pretty intimidating on my end.</p>
<p>Hopefully that doesn't last long.</p>
