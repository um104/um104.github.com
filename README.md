# This is a repo for me to mess around with client-side web dev.

There's lots to learn -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for starters. I'm also learning Jekyll, and with it Liquid and the idea of templating. Learning Markdown, too. Also getting more familiar with Git. So far, that means I've been learning...

 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 * Jekyll
 * Liquid
 * Markdown
 * Git
 
That's a *ton* of stuff to learn! I mean, a **ton**!

If you'd like to see the served version of this code, just go to [um104.github.com](http://um104.github.com/ "um104.gitub.com"). Maybe in the future a more personal website, but for now just this.

    System.out.println("To be honest, I'm just playing around with " + Markdown.toString + " now. My emacs has syntax highlighting, which is making this fun.");

TTFN!
: Ta ta for now!
